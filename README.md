## Get the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/vonbraunlabs/slimx-seed-app.git
```

## Configuration

Since PHP uses namespaces, the seed application comes with the namespace prefix
`\SeedApp`. You can easily replace it with a custom prefix by running:

```
./setup.sh ProjectName
```

## Composer

After setting the new name for the app, run composer install.

```
composer install
```
